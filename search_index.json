Each transcription volunteer will be sent a transcription spreadsheet template and a URL link to a catalogue entry e.g. https://wellcomecollection.org/works/z5p7gm97 Click on the ‘View’ button on the catalogue entry, and this takes you to a specific set of images corresponding to a box full of ‘flimsy slips’ - index cards printed on lightweight, ‘flimsy’ paper. If a message about ‘Archival material less than 100 years old’ pops up, click ‘Accept Terms and Open’ in order to load the flimsy slips into the Viewer. ##Transcribing directly from the Wellcome Collection website The images on the Wellcome Collection website are higher quality than those available when you download a PDF. This means that you can expand the image to full screen without loss of resolution using the zoom controls built into the Viewer. Image Number If you decide to transcribe directly from the website, the image number is the number at the top middle of the Viewer window to the left of the ‘/’. #Using Grp_Wellcome_Transcribers on Teams As part of the Transcribe Wellcome team you will be invited to join the Transcribers’ group on Microsoft Teams. The group is an important part of the transcription process and is the best way to keep up to date with updates, advice and events. There are several channels within the group: General: Where the organisation team/admin post important updates and event announcements. The ‘Files’ section on this channel is where members upload spreadsheets when they want feedback or once they have completed their transcriptions. Library Accession Cards: A channel where members can ask for and read advice in transcribing the Library Accession Registers. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Registers and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Library spreadsheets. Museum Index Cards: A channel for members to ask for and read advice in transcribing the Museum Flimsy Slips. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Slips and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Museum spreadsheets. Visual Material Registers: A channel where members can ask for and read advice in transcribing the Visual Material Registers. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Registers and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Visual Material spreadsheets.
