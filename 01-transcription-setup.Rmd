# Transcription Setup

You can transcribe either directly from the [Wellcome Collection](https://wellcomecollection.org) website or from a downloaded PDF of the digitised images.

Each transcription volunteer will be sent a transcription spreadsheet template and a URL link to a catalogue entry
e.g. [https://wellcomecollection.org/works/z5p7gm97](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/z5p7gm97)

Click on the 'View' button on the catalogue entry, and this takes you to a specific set of images corresponding to a box full of ‘flimsy slips’ - index cards printed on lightweight, ‘flimsy’ paper. If a message about ‘Archival material less than 100 years old’ pops up, click ‘Accept Terms and Open’ in order to load the flimsy slips into the Viewer.


## Transcribing directly from the Wellcome Collection website

The images on the Wellcome Collection website are higher quality than those available when you download a PDF. This means that you can expand the image to full screen without loss of resolution using the zoom controls built into the Viewer.

**Image Number** If you decide to transcribe directly from the website, the image number is the number at the top middle of the Viewer window to the left of the '/'.
