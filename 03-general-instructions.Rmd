# General Transcription Guidelines

## The Transcription Spreadsheet

The column headings in the transcription spreadsheet correspond – broadly – to the headings printed on the flimsy slips, plus some additional columns for recording details which may be useful for future data analysis and online search. 

The style of the printed flimsy slips changed over time, and according to the purpose for which they were used by Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, and some headings were rarely used.

## General instructions

Generally, each flimsy slip will be transcribed onto one row of the spreadsheet, except:

* When one slip has more than one object described in detail, in which case split the description over separate rows, with one row for each object. Give each row/description a sub number in column E [1, 2, 3, 4 etc.] or an alphabetical identifier if letters of the alphabet have been used to distinguish items on the flimsy slip itself (this is rare, but there are some known examples). 
* When one slip represents a short running sequence of A numbers, in which case use a separate row for each number in the sequence, transcribing the details from the card onto each row. Note that you will not be able to copy and paste an entire row of the spreadsheet (which should prevent you accidentally duplicating rows for the same A number), but you can copy and paste column D across to column V if the details are the same as the preceding row.
* Some flimsy slips will have pencil written in addition to pen. If you see this, please transcribe as per usual in their respective fields i.e if half the description is in pen and the other in pencil, transcriber all of it in the description (column K). 
* If it is unclear where the pencil writing is meant to go, please enter it into additional notes (column Q) and highlight this in the transcribers note column.
* If there is an original question mark within a field and/or writing on your flimsy slip, please transcribe this exactly as it shows and make a note that it is in the original flimsy slip in the transcribers notes column.
* If there is something you are unsure of, please note it as […] and make sure there is an ‘unsure’ note in the transcribers column, describing what it is you are unsure of.
* For any text which has been scored through, do the same in the transcription. If you do use the strikethrough, or any other formatted text, you must use the appropriate tagging e.g. <s>transcribed text here</s>  or <i>transcribed text here</i> for italics.

You may notice gaps in the accession numbers, this is normal. Please continue to work with the numbers assigned in column A.
